D-Light VoIP is a Voice over IP light program, 
it doesn't need to have a user account or to
enter any other information, you only have to
know your IP address and the IP address of the
person that you want to speek to.

D-Light VoIP is not for the regular computer
user, it is designed to be not easy to use
but fast and light.
